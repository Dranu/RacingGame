Network:

( 1) Everyone - Prediction:

"When we send input-packet to server we could add timestamp on it to be later added on server's coordinate/angle-packet for client. 
Then we could have a list on client side where we add the result of the prediction with that timestamp.

Then later, when we receive coordinate/angle-packet from server, we could read the timestamp from the packet and use it to 
find the correct prediction result from prediction results-list and check if the coordinates/angle match. 
If not, then fix our car's current position." ) DONE I think

2) Everyone - Winner detection (implementation details depend on whether we get prediction working or not)

3) Everyone - Documentation

BONUS (if there's still time):
4) Collision detection
