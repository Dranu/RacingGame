Game:
1) JM - Edges of the track (redline)
2) JM - Checkpoints 
3) JS - Edges of the image (SOLVED, just needs to be added to the game)
4) JK - Give every player a different car-image 
5) Anyone - Rename collisionDetect to terrainDetect  

Network:
1) Server disconnects -> close game window and receive DC message
2) Client disconnects -> should the car still be drawn or erased? 
2) How to notify new clients that max players achieved (currently it tries to listen but nothing happens)
3) Everyone - Prediction
4) TBD - Collision?
5) Everyone - Combine chat and game
