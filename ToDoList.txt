Game:
1) JM - Edges of the track (redline)
2) JM - Checkpoints 
3) JS - Edges of the image (SOLVED, just needs to be added to the game)
4) JK - Give every player a different car-image 
5) Anyone - Rename collisionDetect to terrainDetect  

Network:
1) JK - Server disconnects -> close game window and receive DC message
2) JM - Client disconnects -> should the car still be drawn or erased? 
3) JK - How to notify new clients that max players achieved (currently it tries to listen but nothing happens)
4) TBD - Collision?
5) Everyone - Combine chat and game
6) Everyone - Prediction: 
"When we send input-packet to server we could add timestamp on it to be later added on server's coordinate/angle-packet for client. Then we could have a list on client side where we add the result of the prediction with that timestamp.

Then later, when we receive coordinate/angle-packet from server, we could read the timestamp from the packet and use it to find the correct prediction result from prediction results-list and check if the coordinates/angle match. If not, then fix our car's current position."
