Game:
1) JK - Give every player a different car-image

Network:
1) JK - Server disconnects -> close game window and receive DC message
DatagramSocket has a method called connect(), which makes socket receive
packets only from specified address/port and thus automatically makes it
possible for socket to recognize if it still exists in that specific server 
end when sending and receiving packets (and then resulting in an exception
if it doesn't). 

This seems more realiable solution than using timeouts because there might
be a long moment in the chat phase where nobody is saying anything and 
thus clients would think that server has crashed/quit even when it's not.



2) JM - Client disconnects -> should the car still be drawn or erased? 
3) JK - How to notify new clients that max players achieved (currently it tries to listen but nothing happens)
4) TBD - Collision?
5) Everyone - Combine chat and game
6) Everyone - Prediction: 
"When we send input-packet to server we could add timestamp on it to be later added on server's coordinate/angle-packet for client. 
Then we could have a list on client side where we add the result of the prediction with that timestamp.

Then later, when we receive coordinate/angle-packet from server, we could read the timestamp from the packet and use it to 
find the correct prediction result from prediction results-list and check if the coordinates/angle match. 
If not, then fix our car's current position."
