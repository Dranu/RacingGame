Game:
1) Edges of the track (redline) - JM
2) Checkpoints - JM
3) Edges of the image (SOLVED, just needs to be added to the game)  - JS
4) Give every player a different car-image - JK (?)
5) Rename collisionDetect to terrainDetect - anyone

Network:
1) Server disconnects -> close game window and receive DC message
2) Client disconnects -> should the car still be drawn or erased? 
2) How to notify new clients that max players achieved (currently it tries to listen but nothing happens)
3) Prediction - everyone
4) Collision? - TBD
5) Combine chat and game
