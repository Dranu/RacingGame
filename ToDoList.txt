Network:
1) JM - Client disconnects -> should the car still be drawn or erased? 
2) TBD - Collision?
3) Everyone - Combine chat and game
4) Everyone - Prediction: 
"When we send input-packet to server we could add timestamp on it to be later added on server's coordinate/angle-packet for client. 
Then we could have a list on client side where we add the result of the prediction with that timestamp.

Then later, when we receive coordinate/angle-packet from server, we could read the timestamp from the packet and use it to 
find the correct prediction result from prediction results-list and check if the coordinates/angle match. 
If not, then fix our car's current position."
